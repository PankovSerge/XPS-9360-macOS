## Bootloader Firmware
- Default bootloader: OpenCore `0.6.7` See more [info](https://github.com/the-Quert/XPS-9360-macOS/blob/master/README.md#Migrate-bootloader-from-Clover-to-OpenCore) about migration.
- No longer maintained: Clover `r5118`
## Pre-Installation
#### Create bootable USB installer: (With gibMacOS)
  - Running [gibMacOS](https://github.com/corpnewt/gibMacOS), then download the version you prefer (gibMacOS script is allowed to download macOS images on all OS platforms with Python installed).
  - Finding and running `InstallAssistant.pkg` under the path `macOS Downloads`.
  - Erase your USB drive with `Disk Utility`(Name: "USB"; Format: "Mac OS Extended (Journaled)"; Scheme: "GUID")
  - Running the following commands to make bootable USB with `Install macOS Big Sur.app`:
  ```
    sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Big\ Sur.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/USB
  ```
  - Running the commands to mount the EFI partion of USB:
  ```
    sudo diskutil mount /dev/disk3s1
  ```
  - Copy the whole repository to EFI partition to the path mentioned above. (You have to create an empty EFI directory, and put the whole repo in it).

#### DVMT
  - Enter `BIOS/Boot Sequence` in `BIOS`, add `Boot Entry` with `/EFI/CLOVER/tools/DVMT.efi` , then run the following commands
```
  setup_var 0x4de 0x00  // Disable CFG Lock
  setup_var 0x785 0x06  // Increase DVMT pre-allocated size to 192M For FHD version, it's also recommended setting to 192M
  setup_var 0x786 0x03  // Increase CFG Memory to maximum
```

#### Format SSD with 4K sectors for `APFS` - Creating a Linux bootable drive is needed.
  - Choose any Linux distribution you like, I prefer [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
  - Formatting SSD to `4K sectors` with `nvme-cli`... for working better with `APFS`, see `Step 2` in this [guide](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/guide-sierra-on-hp-spectre-x360-native-kaby-lake-support.228302/).

#### Get compatible with LITEON and PLEXTOR SSD - If you are not using with LITEON or PLEXTOR SSD, skip it.
  - To solve the problem, `config.plist` with patches is needed.
  - The `config.plist` with patches is under the path [config for LITEON](https://github.com/the-Quert/XPS-9360-macOS/tree/master/CLOVER/config_for_LITEON).
  - Rename to `config.plist` and try one at each time, one of them would be capatible with your SSD.

## SMBIOS
   - Default SMBIOS settings of this repo is `MacbookPro15,2`.
   - `Serial Number` and `SmUUID` are erased beforehand, you need to generaete on your own.

## CPUFriend
   - The kexts and SSDT for `i7-8550U` has put [here](https://github.com/the-Quert/macOS-Mojave-XPS9360/tree/master/CPUFriend/i7-8550U), by working SMBIOS with `MacbookPro15,2`.
   - You have to put `CPUFriend.kext` & `CPUFrindDataProvider.kext` in both `/CLOVER/kexts/Other` and `Library/Extensions`, then [rebuild cache](https://github.com/the-Quert/macOS-Mojave-XPS9360/blob/master/Commands/rebuild_cache.sh).
   - Furthermore, you also have to put `SSDT-CPUF.aml` in `/EFI/CLOVER/ACPI/patched` for working as normal after awake.

##### If you need to generate new CPUFriend kexts, refer to [Commands](https://github.com/the-Quert/macOS-Mojave-XPS9360/tree/master/Commands), and follow [here](https://github.com/acidanthera/CPUFriend)

## Enable eGPU with Thunderbolt 3
   - You need to set `No Security` in TB3 BIOS option.
   - Stop `Clover` when it counts down during booting with pressing `Space`.
   - Connect the TB3 cable to XPS.
   - Turn on the eGPU.
   - Wait for few seconds, and press `Enter` to boot macOS.

## Custom setting the delay between trackpad and keyboard
   To do that you need to edit `Info.plist` in `VoodooI2CHID.kext`:
   - Open the `Info.plist` in the `VoodooI2CHID.kext` with any Text Editor(I use [Atom](https://atom.io/))
   - Finding the `QuietTimeAfterTyping`
   - Changing the `value` you prefer
   ##### I have preset the `value` to `0`

## More Custom Settings
   - Refer to [Commands](https://github.com/the-Quert/macOS-Mojave-XPS9360/tree/master/Commands) for more customization.

## HiDPI
   - Use [one-key-HiDPI](https://github.com/xzhih/one-key-hidpi)

## Fix Blurry Fonts for Non-Retina Displays
   - Refer to [here](https://osxdaily.com/2018/09/26/fix-blurry-thin-fonts-text-macos-mojave/).
##### If booting with `Clover`, blurry font is required to fix.
##### If booting with `OpenCore`, font is clear as Retina, no need to fix.

## Fix AppleID issue on macOS Catalina
- If you encounter the problem with AppleID which cannot login and logout, this problem happened on both
Hackintosh and Macintosh.
- Fix this issue with the follwing commands...
```BASH
        sudo -v
        killall -9 accountsd com.apple.iCloudHelper
        defaults delete MobileMeAccounts
        rm -rf ~/Library/Accounts
        killall -9 accountsd com.apple.iCloudHelper
        sudo reboot
```

## Fix the AirPods choppy/unreliable when connected to macOS
- Open `System Preferences` > `Sound` > `Input`
- Change `Sound Input` from `Airpods` to `Internal Microphone`
- Possible explanation:     
Since `BCM94360CS2`/`DW1560`/`BCM94360NG` are running with `Bluetooth 4.0`, which has too low bandwidth to handle both input/output at a high quality.     
Therefore, changing `Sound Input` to `Internal Microphone` to ensure audio output is working as normal.

## Optional Settings
### CPU Undervolting
#### If having the same CPU as mine, you can do the undervolting settings below.
#### Warning!!! This may cause crash on your device, please be aware of that.
 Enter `BIOS/Boot Sequence` , add new `Boot Option` with `/EFI/CLOVER/tools/DVMT.efi`, then run the following commands...
 - Overclock, CFG, WDT & XTU enable
 ```BASH
        setup_var 0x4DE 0x00
        setup_var 0x64D 0x01
        setup_var 0x64E 0x01
 ```
 - Undervolting values:
 ```BASH
        setup_var 0x653 0x64     // CPU: -100 mV
        setup_var 0x655 0x01     // Negative voltage for 0x653
        setup_var 0x85A 0x1E     // GPU: -30 mV
        setup_var 0x85C 0x01     // Negative voltage for 0x85A
```

### Swapping SSD
  - You need an external NVMe reader to carry your new SSD as an external drive.
  - Under macOS environment, using `Disk Utility` format your new SSD as `APFS` format.
  - Using [Carbon Copy Cloner](https://bombich.com/download), to clone the whole System Disk to your new drive.

### Upgrading macOS
  - Before upgrading, remember to backup with `Time Machine` through external drive.
  - [Create bootable USB drive](https://github.com/the-Quert/XPS-9360-macOS#create-bootable-usb-installer) with the version of macOS you prefer, and replace files under path `/EFI` in EFI partition with this repo.
  - After booting sucessfully, copy the whole repo to you EFI partition. (The commands to mount EFI partition is provided above.)
  - If you use `DW1560`, follow the [guide](https://github.com/the-Quert/XPS-9360-macOS#post-installation).
  - Refer to [shell script](https://github.com/the-Quert/XPS-9360-macOS#running-shell-script-in-terminal) part, and follow the commands.
  - Follow the guide to set your [CPUFriend](https://github.com/the-Quert/XPS-9360-macOS/blob/master/README.md#cpufriend).
  - Recovery you data and settings from your backup through `Migration Assistant`.

### Migrate bootloader from Clover to OpenCore
  - Copy the OC folder to EFI partition.
  - Clear caches of `Clover`, and compile your own DSDTs by running the followig commands...
  ```
        bash /Volumes/EFI/EFI/OC/trans.sh
        bash /Volumes/EFI/EFI/OC/XPS_OC.sh --compile-dsdt
  ```
  - Enter `BIOS/Boot Sequence` in `BIOS`, add `Boot Entry` with path `/EFI/OC/OpenCore.efi`
  - Reboot and enjoy the flight, and feel free to file issues if encounter any problems.

  - Known info
  ```
    Digital Audio (HDMI / DVI / DP)
    To enable digital audio it is necessary to set the necessary properties and, usually, patch the connectors.
    To enable audio in general and HDMI in particular use WEG along with AppleALC.kext.
    On 10.10.5 and above, WEG automatically changes the connector-type of DP (00040000) to HDMI (00080000) if no custom patches are used.
    The actual connection may be of any type (HDMI / DVI / DP), but for the digital audio to function the connector-type must explicitly be HDMI.
```       
  When HDMI plugged in, macOS would recognize as DP (busID: 0x05), not HDMI (busID: 0x04).     
  - Table of busID and ports are listed below:

|   DP     |   HDMI   |    DVI    |
| -------- | -------- | --------- |
|   0x02   |   0x00   |    0x01   |
|   0x04   |   0x02   |    0x02   |
|   0x05   |   0x04   |    0x04   |
|   0x06   |   0x06   |    0x06   |
   - `framebuffer-conX-enable`     
      `01000000` -> Enable, `00000000` -> Disable
   - `framebuffer-conX-type`
      `00000800` -> HDMI output, `00000400` -> DP output
   - `framebuffer-conX-index`
      `fffffff` -> Block
   - `framebuffer-unifiedmem`
      `00000080` -> VRAM to 2048M, `000000C0` -> VRAM to 3072M
   - `framebuffer-fbmem`
      `00009000` -> 9M for FHD, `00000003` -> 48M for QHD/UHD
   - All framebuffer values can be insert as `NUMBER` type, except `ig-platform-id`.

### USB Ports Mapping
  - Table of Type and Dev Speed are listed below:

|  USB 2 (XHC)  |  USB 3 (XHC)  | Thunderbolt 3 (TBTU) |        Dev Speed       |
| ------------- | ------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
|      HS01     |      HS01     |                      |    12/480 Mbps         |
|      HS02     |      HS02     |                      |    12/480 Mbps         |
|               |      SS01     |                      |    5 Gbps              |
|               |      SS02     |                      |    5 Gbps              |

      To work with `WhateverGreen.kext`, fixing BackLight.
   - `brcmfx-country=XX`     
      Change the country code to XX (US, CN, #a, ...) For Broadcom WiFi card.
   - `brcmfx-country=#a`     
      Enables 80MHz wide channels on the 5GHz spectrum. For Broadcom WiFi card.
   - `agdpmod=vit9696`     
      Disable check for `board-id`.
      
### XCPM and HWP
   - Verify working `XCPM` configuration by typing the commands below
   ```BASH
      sysctl machdep.xcpm.mode
      // If returns '1', which means the XCPM is active.
   ```
   - Verify if the `X86PlatformPlugin.kext` is loaded
   ```BASH
      kextstat|grep -y x86plat
   ```
